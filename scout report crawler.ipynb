surgery to start the year  so he has missed some time early in the season   He is a skilled offensive player that can help his team in many ways   Brooks is a crafty scorer off the dribble that has a good set of moves that he can use to get past defenders to garner scores in the paint   Also  he can make spot up and pull up jumpers to space the floor for his team   However  Brooks can be quite inconsistent as a shooter  and as his lack of an elite first step may make it tough to get past more athletic defenders off the dribble   Brooks may also be an adequate playmaker   He is an unselfish player that will set up scores for his teammates   But sometimes  he can play too out of control at times  which can lead him to commit some turnovers   He may only be an average defensive player at best   He also does not have elite physical tools  and also plays in a zone defense  so he may not always be tasked to guard his man  but rather an area instead   In addition  he is helped out by having two shot blockers behind  which allows him to be more aggressive defensively   But as he also does not collect many steals or blocks and sometimes is tasked to match up to bigger players  the question may be how well he can guard more athletic opponents on the floor   In general  Dillon Brooks is an intriguing prospect   He may have the offensive skills and the intangibles to carve out a niche as a role player in the NBA  as he could end up being in the league for quite awhile  Strong finisher around the basket Gifted shooter from all over the floor Good scorer off the dribble Makes

occasional floater every once in a while   Plus  he is a really good shooter that has great range  and he can make a variety of shots when he is on the floor   On the other hand  he may only be an average playmaker for a player his size   He has the speed and the ability to excel as a pick and roll ball handler  but his decision making can be spotty at times   Dorsey may not always get his teammates involved enough on offense  and he can play too recklessly at times  which can lead to turnovers   Also  Dorsey is a good rebounder for a player his size   He has great size and physical tools to play the point  and his size also allows him to play the off guard position   Defensively  he may be about average   When he is dialed in  he will move his feet well  as he can get some steals and stops to help his team on the floor   But sometimes  he can be prone to having lapses defensively  which can lead him to pick up quick fouls and allow scores   In general  Tyler Dorsey may have the skills to be a potential first rounder  whether or not if it is in the upcoming draft or sometime in the future   He will need to show NBA teams that he can run the point  but his scoring
